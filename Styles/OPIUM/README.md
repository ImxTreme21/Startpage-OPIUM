Nope, I'm lazy af, I just edited this startpage bc I liked the style and added some simple stuff like a random image instead of a single one, random song, and I tried to add a weather widget but It didn't fit like I wanted and I'm too lazy to make it look good. Also, thanks to ChatGPT for helping out with all the javascript since I don't know shit about it.
