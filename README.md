# A TRUE OPIUM STARTPAGE

Minimalist OPIUM starpage for yall carti meatriders.

> “This man was in philly installing this startpage mid pandemic the day my son was born even tho it was a scheduled c section.“ - Iggy Azalea

- The style its based on what I like and I know prolly everyone won't like the terminal style of the page, feel free to change it.
- If you like other artists like idk Kanye, Lil Uzi Vert, Taylor Swift or whatever I encourage you to change the pics and songs to something that suits your liking 
- Carti drop the fucking album.

## Questions nobody asked:

#### Q: How  do I use this incredible, pretty, amazing, beautiful and definetely original startpage?

A: Read [this](https://github.com/ImxTreme21/Startpage-OPIUM/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-instructions)

#### Q: How to I edit this to my liking?

A: Uhh, edit the html file, add images and music to their respective folders and edit the javascript.
If you don't know anything about code don't worry, there are instructions inside the html and js file.

#### Q: The font is not the same as the preview, why?

A: The font used in the preview is [Monocraft](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft), if you want it to show properly install it, if you prefer another font you can change it in the CSS file.

#### Q: Who draw Carti and Ken in anime style?

A: [This dude](https://www.instagram.com/yukimura.exe/?img_index=1), show him some support.

#### Q: Did you make all of this from scratch?

A: Nope, I'm lazy af, I just edited [this startpage](https://github.com/ycatsh/boring-fox) bc I liked the style and added some simple stuff like a random image instead of a single one, random song, and I tried to add a weather widget but It didn't fit like I wanted and I'm too lazy to make it look good. Also, thanks to ChatGPT for helping out with all the javascript since I don't know shit about it.

#### Q: How do I contribute a custom style?

A: Make a pull request with your style, if my washing machine likes it I will push an update (honestly idk if making a PR would work, I dont use github very often)

#### Q: How do I get a gf?

A: Take a shower and maybe find a job idk
