# A TRUE OPIUM STARTPAGE

Minimalist OPIUM starpage for yall carti meatriders.

> “This man was in philly installing this startpage mid pandemic the day my son was born even tho it was a scheduled c section.“ - Iggy Azalea

- The style its based on what I like and I know prolly everyone won't like the terminal style of the page, feel free to change it.
- If you like other artists like idk Kanye, Lil Uzi Vert, Taylor Swift or whatever I encourage you to change the pics and songs to something that suits your liking (and please make a pull request or fork this repo so more people can choose between styles)
- Carti drop the fucking album.

#### Did you make all of this from scratch?

Nope, I'm lazy af, I just edited [this startpage](https://github.com/ycatsh/boring-fox) bc I liked the style and added some simple stuff like a random image instead of a single one, random song, and I tried to add a weather widget but It didn't fit like I wanted and I'm too lazy to make it look good. Also, thanks to ChatGPT for helping out with all the javascript since I don't know shit about it.
